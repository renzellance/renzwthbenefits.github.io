              In my spare time, you'll find me playing video games and board games with my friends, binge watching a series,
              making up the most random songs or jingles with my guitar, or looking for the next best place to get some grub.

              I enjoy programming in general as it forces me to often think outside the box and encourages me to keep on learning.
              Ever since I was younger, I've been interested in technology, and due to my early exposure to gaming, I was fascinated with
              the concept of creating something out of virtually nothing and making money out of it. <strong>Selling pixels!</strong>

              It was an eye-opening moment for me, so during grade school I started self-studying and created a game using an app called
              RPGMaker XP. I remember learning Ruby back then in order to implement some of the custom functionality I wanted. I wasn't
              able to finish it in the end, but it's what got me into programming.

              Recently, I've decided to pivot my career towards Product Management. A lot of my time and attention is now focused on UX
              and researching about our users and the business end of things. The thing I find most interesting is understanding user
              behavior and how it can be influenced by experimenting on loops, funnels and other product features.
